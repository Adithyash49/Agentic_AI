Agentic_AI

An agentic AI workflow is a process where an LLM based app executes multiple steps to complete a task.

Degrees of autonomy: Low, semi, high

Benefits of AI: Better performance, parallelism, Modular

Task decomposition into smaller parts

Agentic Design pattern: Reflection, Tool, planning, multi-agent collaboration

Evals: Objective and subjective evaluation


Workflow: Draft, Reflect, Revise

Before interacting with the language models, we initialize the aisuite client. 
This setup loads environment variables (e.g., API keys) from a .env file to securely authenticate with backend services. 
The ai.Client() instance will be used to make all model calls throughout this workflow..
